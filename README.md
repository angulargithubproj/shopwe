# Shopwe

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.
the idea is to make a shop that makes it easy to get the good deals 
so shopwe is a store containing 6 articles that are valid for only 24 hours 
the product list will be updated every day  and new deals will be revealed

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
